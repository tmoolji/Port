        <p class = description>A 2D, tile-based video game with a pseudo-randomly generated world.
          Players attempt to shut off all lights on the board before time runs out, while evading
          enemies that track them using the A* search algorithm. Progress can be saved and loaded.
          A heads-up display tells the player the type of the tile they are hovering over with
          their mouse, the time remaining, and the number of lights left on the board.</p>

        <p class = description>A local version control system that replicates the
          basic features of git, including creating and deleting repositories, storing
          commits, checking out to previous commits, branching, resolving merge conflicts,
          uploading to remote repositories and tracking information about the current
          head state. Utilizes SHA-1 hashing to serialize and store files.</p>

        <p class = description>A joint compiler and interpreter that converts text
          files written in Scheme to Python and runs them. Handles all basic Scheme
          commands, including basic mathematical operations, special forms like
          “lambda” and “define,” control flow statements like “if/else,” “cond,”
          and “switch.” Employs rudimentary error checking and returns a simple
          error message with the offending line number.</p>

          and the top and bottom 5 performers based on daily percentage returns.
          Prices and performance are recalculated when the user presses the “Refresh”

        <p class = description>Designed and implemented a setup using a QTH bulb,
          monochromator, and lock-in amplifier to test the efficacy of Silicon,
          InGaN, and AlGaInP photodetectors for a range of wavelengths in the
          visible spectrum (380 – 740nm). Using the photocurrent as a proxy for
          signal strength, identified the optimal design materials and dimensions
          required to achieve the desired signal to noise ratio.</p>
